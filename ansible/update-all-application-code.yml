# Perform a rolling update of both Orchea and Switchboard code and configuration, one  host at a time.
#
# Notes:
#
# This is the general pattern for a rolling upgrade. 
# 
# The "serial: 1" setting controls how many nodes are restarted at a time. For large clusters,
# increase this.
#
# Rigbt now we are relying on the nginx failover ot handle uptime.  Should maybe remove from nginx beforehand though so there
# is nto a slowdown.
